# POPULATION TRACKER

## INITIAL DEVELOPMENT

Create a static webpage and add Tableau visualization dashboard for hawaii state taking various census tract data from social explorer for ACS 2021 5 year estimates data. After data was processed and the data for population 25 years or over with Bachelors degree or better was presented in the tableau sheet, the sheet was integrated with react app and presented for users to view and use it for further purposes.

The map with the data in tableau was presented by downloading the proper spatial file from census shapefiles and indicating for year and state with layer type as census tracts.
